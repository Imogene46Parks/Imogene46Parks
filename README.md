## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a junior mobile developer focused on building Android applications and exploring best practices in modern Android development. This space is where I document my projects, experiments, and learning progressâ€”especially as I dive deeper into UI testing and app architecture.

Iâ€™m passionate about creating intuitive and responsive mobile experiences using Kotlin and Android Studio. My projects aim to reflect clean code principles, thoughtful design, and a growing understanding of how to build scalable, maintainable apps. Whether itâ€™s implementing common Android components like RecyclerViews and Navigation, or integrating APIs to display dynamic data, each project is an opportunity to learn and improve.

A key part of my current journey is gaining confidence with UI testing. Iâ€™m learning how to write effective tests using tools like Espresso and Jetpackâ€™s testing libraries, ensuring that the apps I build not only look good but work reliably across different user interactions and screen states.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find beginner to intermediate Android apps, complete with clear structure, comments, and test cases where applicable. Each project is organized to help othersâ€”especially fellow learnersâ€”follow along easily, understand the codebase, and even contribute.

I believe in learning through doing, and Iâ€™m always looking to apply what Iâ€™ve studied in practical, hands-on ways. I also value feedback, and I welcome collaboration from others who are working on similar paths in Android development.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to explore the code, fork a project, or open an issue. Whether you're learning, reviewing, or just curious, I hope you find something helpful or inspiring here.
